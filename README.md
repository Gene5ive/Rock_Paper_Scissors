# rock_paper_scissors

This program receives a hand of rock, paper, scissors from a spec test and returns the winning hand.
Currently, it is set to play the hand "scissors" against the spec test's "rock" and lose.

Included in the root folder are lib/rps.rb and spec/rps_spec.rb

rps_spec.rb requires 'rspec', 'rps', and 'pry'
